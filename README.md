associate summary
-----
During Q2 I had the opportunity to finish my master's degree with a focus on cloud computing and high performance. I focused a lot on getting to know our customers better and being aware of the demands coming from the SSAs.



I noticed that there is a demand for materials aimed at customers who make more use of microsoft technologies and I started a study focused on how to increase our penetration with this audience.



I was immensely happy with some results obtained during some interactions due to the great feedback received by co-workers.

My willingness and desire to serve the end customer beyond technology makes me want to understand more about their business area and therefore propose a more complete solution beyond "just" the products I am responsible for.



For the next quarter, I intend to continue increasing my knowledge of Red Hat solutions, mainly runtimes, and plan how to further expand our reach with solutions that are increasingly focused on real problems and scenarios.

We will have two major changes planned for Q3, RHBK and EAP 8. I plan a series of articles and tutorials to facilitate both the work of SAs when presenting the solution and for customers and interested parties to observe and awaken the desire to try it.
